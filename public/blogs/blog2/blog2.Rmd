title: "Exchange @ Schulich School of Business "
---


I had an exchange experience studying in Schulich School of Business in Toronto, Canada. During the exchange term, I applied 2 different investment strategies in the US stock market and comleted the group investment project using Stocktreck, a platform for virtual investment. And I got to know many good friends in this process.

Apart from studying, I also visited many places in Canada, such as the Niagara Falls, and Yellowknife. I like the dry seasons and really enjoyed my exchange life in this country.
