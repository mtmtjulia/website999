Every so often, we hear warnings from commentators on the "inverted yield curve" and its predictive power with respect to recessions. An explainer what a [inverted yield curve is can be found here](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy-yieldcurve-explainer/explainer-what-is-an-inverted-yield-curve-idUSKBN1O50GA). If you'd rather listen to something, here is a great podcast from [NPR on yield curve indicators](https://www.podbean.com/media/share/dir-4zgj9-6aefd11)

In addition, many articles and commentators think that, e.g., [*Yield curve inversion is viewed as a harbinger of recession*](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-14/u-k-yield-curve-inverts-for-first-time-since-financial-crisis). One can always doubt whether inversions are truly a harbinger of recessions, and [use the attached parable on yield curve inversions](https://twitter.com/5_min_macro/status/1161627360946511873).


```{r yield_curve_parable.jpg, echo=FALSE,eval=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "yield_curve_parable.jpg"), error = FALSE)
```

In our case we will look at US data and use the [FRED database](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/) to download historical yield curve rates, and plot the yield curves since 1999 to see when the yield curves flatten. 

```{r yield_curve_challenge, echo=FALSE,eval=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "yield_curve_challenge.png"), error = FALSE)
```


First, we download monthly rates for different durations. 

```{r get_rates, warning=FALSE}
# Get a list of FRED codes for US rates and US yield curve; choose monthly frequency
# to see, eg., the 3-month T-bill https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/TB3MS
tickers <- c('TB3MS', # 3-month Treasury bill (or T-bill)
             'TB6MS', # 6-month
             'GS1',   # 1-year
             'GS2',   # 2-year, etc....
             'GS3',
             'GS5',
             'GS7',
             'GS10',
             'GS20',
             'GS30')  #.... all the way to the 30-year rate

# Turn  FRED codes to human readable variables
myvars <- c('3-Month Treasury Bill',
            '6-Month Treasury Bill',
            '1-Year Treasury Rate',
            '2-Year Treasury Rate',
            '3-Year Treasury Rate',
            '5-Year Treasury Rate',
            '7-Year Treasury Rate',
            '10-Year Treasury Rate',
            '20-Year Treasury Rate',
            '30-Year Treasury Rate')

maturity <- c('3m', '6m', '1y', '2y','3y','5y','7y','10y','20y','30y')

# by default R will sort these maturities alphabetically; but since we want
# to keep them in that exact order, we recast maturity as a factor 
# or categorical variable, with the levels defined as we want
maturity <- factor(maturity, levels = maturity)

# Create a lookup dataset
mylookup<-data.frame(symbol=tickers,var=myvars, maturity=maturity)
# Take a look:
mylookup %>% 
  knitr::kable()

df <- tickers %>% tidyquant::tq_get(get="economic.data", 
                   from="1960-01-01")   # start from January 1960

glimpse(df)
```

And we make it more readable.


```{r join_data, warning=FALSE}

yield_curve <-left_join(df,mylookup,by="symbol") 
```

# Plotting the yield curve

## Yields on US rates by duration since 1960

```{r yield_curve_1, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE,out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "yield_curve1.png"), error = FALSE)
```

```{r yields_on_US_Treasury_Rate,out.width="100%"}
#reorder the "vars" by its maturity
yield_curve<- yield_curve%>%
  mutate(ordered_var=factor(var,levels=myvars))

#plot historical yields change since 1960
ggplot(yield_curve,aes(x=date,y=price),group=1)+
  geom_line(aes(colour=ordered_var),show.legend = FALSE)+
  
  #add labs
  labs(title= "Yields on U.S. Treasury Rates since 1960",
       x=NULL,
       y="%",
       caption = "Source: St Louis Federal Reserve Economic Database (FRED)")+
  
  #facet by maturity
  facet_wrap(~ordered_var,ncol=2,dir="h")+
  
  #adjust theme
  theme_bw()+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size=8,face="bold"),
        plot.caption = element_text(size=6),
        strip.text = element_text(size=6),
        axis.text= element_text(size=6),
        axis.title = element_text(size=6))+
  NULL

```

As you can see, yields went up and reached the peak around 1960s, then it gradually went down and became quite stable in the past decade.

## Monthly yields on US rates by duration since 1999 on a year-by-year basis

To make it more clear, we plot the monthly yield by duration to see the difference across long-term yield and short-term yield in the past 20 years.

```{r yield_curve_2, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "yield_curve2.png"), error = FALSE)
```

```{r us_yield_curve_since_1999,out.width="100%"}
#add the year of date and filter yields since 1999
yield_curve2<- yield_curve%>%
  mutate(date=ymd(date),year=year(date))%>%
  filter(year>=1999)

#plot monthly yields on Us Treasury rates by different duration
ggplot(yield_curve2,aes(x=maturity,y=price))+
  geom_line(aes(colour=year,group=date),show.legend = FALSE)+
  
  #add labs
  labs(title= "US Yield Curve",
       x="Maturity",
       y="Yield(%)",
       caption = "Source: St Louis Federal Reserve Economic Database (FRED)")+
  
  #facet by maturity and reorder the them
  facet_wrap(~year,ncol=4,dir="h")+
  
  #adjust theme
  theme_bw()+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size=8,face="bold"),
        plot.caption = element_text(size=6),
        strip.text = element_text(size=6),
        axis.text= element_text(size=6),
        axis.title = element_text(size=6))+
  NULL
```

Obviously, the yield spread is flatter from year 1999-2000, and the same pattern appeared in period 2005-2006 and period 2018-2019. Except for the last one, the flatted yields could be related to the recessions in 2001 and 2007.

## 3-month and 10-year yields since 1999

```{r yield_curve_3, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "yield_curve3.png"), error = FALSE)
```
Typically, we use the 3-month T-bills and 10-year US Treasury Bond rate to see how the rate spread change by years since 1999.

```{r 3m_10y_yield_change_by_years,out.width="100%"}
#filter 3-month T-Bills and 10-year Treasury rates since 1999
yield_curve3<- yield_curve%>%
  mutate(date=ymd(date),year=year(date))%>%
  filter(year>=1999,maturity%in%c("10y","3m"))
  
#plot yields change on 3-month T-Bills and 10-year Treasury Rate
ggplot(yield_curve3,aes(x=date,y=price))+
  geom_line(aes(colour=ordered_var,group=ordered_var),show.legend = TRUE)+
  
  #add labs
  labs(title= "Yields on 3-month and 10-year US Treasury rates since 1999",
       x=NULL,
       y="%",
       caption = "Source: St Louis Federal Reserve Economic Database (FRED)")+
  
  #change theme
  theme_bw()+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size=8,face="bold"),
        plot.caption = element_text(size=6),
        axis.text= element_text(size=6),
        axis.title = element_text(size=6),
        legend.text = element_text(size=6),
        legend.title = element_blank())+
  NULL
```

And we could get the same conclusion here, that the yield curve seem to flatten before the 2 recessions since 1999. However, a yield curve flattening didn't always mean a recession is coming in the US. Before the breakout COVID-19, the yield curve flattened since 2018. Yet it is hard to say whether we are experiencing an recession if the pandemic didn't exist.

We will take a look at this further by calculating the difference of 10-year yield and 3-month yield.

#Plotting the spread

For the first, we create a dataframe with all US recessions since 1946:

```{r setup_US-recessions, warning=FALSE}

# get US recession dates after 1946 from Wikipedia 
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recessions_in_the_United_States

recessions <- tibble(
  from = c("1948-11-01", "1953-07-01", "1957-08-01", "1960-04-01", "1969-12-01", "1973-11-01", "1980-01-01","1981-07-01", "1990-07-01", "2001-03-01", "2007-12-01"),  
  to = c("1949-10-01", "1954-05-01", "1958-04-01", "1961-02-01", "1970-11-01", "1975-03-01", "1980-07-01", "1982-11-01", "1991-03-01", "2001-11-01", "2009-06-01") 
  )  %>% 
  mutate(From = ymd(from), 
         To=ymd(to),
         duration_days = To-From)

recessions
```

We choose the recessions after 1960 and tried to find the connection between the lower spread and recessions. Red areas shows the time that the 3-month yield excess 10-month yield, which suggests a negative yield spread.

```{r filter_US-resessions and generate the plot,out.width="100%"}
#Calculate the spread since 1960: 10year - 3months
yield_curve4<- yield_curve%>%
  select(price,date,maturity)%>%
  pivot_wider(names_from="maturity",names_prefix="price_",values_from="price")%>%
  mutate(spread=price_10y-price_3m)

#filter the recessions since 1960
recessions1<-recessions%>%
  filter(year(From)>=1959)

library(scales)

#Replicate Graph for spread changes and recessions since 1960
ggplot(yield_curve4,aes(x=date,y=spread))+
  
  
  #Shaded areas correspond to recessions
  geom_rect(data=recessions1, inherit.aes=F, aes(xmin=From, xmax=To, ymin=-Inf, ymax=+Inf), fill='grey', alpha=0.5)+
  
  #plot spread
  geom_line(group=1,size=0.5,color="black")+
  
  #add line for zero spread
  geom_hline(aes(yintercept=0))+

  #color the positive spread blue and negative spread red
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin=0,ymax=if_else(spread<0,spread,0)),
              fill="#EAB5B7",alpha=0.5)+
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin=0,ymax=if_else(spread>0,spread,0)),
              fill="#2E74C0",alpha=0.5)+
  
  #Add rug bars at the bottom
  geom_rug(sides="b",
           aes(color=if_else(spread>0,"#EAB5B7","#2E74C0"),alpha=0.5),
           show.legend = FALSE)+
  
  #Add titles and caption
  labs(title="Yield Curve Inversion: 10-year minus 3-month U.S. Treasury rates",
       subtitle="Difference in % points, monthly averages \nShaded areas correspond to recessions",
       x=NULL,
       y="Difference (10 year-3 month) yield in %",
       caption="Source: FRED, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis")+
  
  #Adjust the axis and the theme
  scale_x_date(date_breaks="2 years",
               date_labels="%Y")+
  theme(panel.border = element_blank(),
        panel.background = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.minor = element_line(colour="#ECECEC"),
        panel.grid.major = element_line(colour="#ECECEC"),
        plot.title = element_text(size=10,face="bold"),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(size=6,face="italic"),
        plot.caption = element_text(size=6),
        axis.ticks= element_blank(),
        axis.text= element_text(size=6),
        axis.title = element_text(size=8))+
  NULL
```

We could see that usually there's a grey shaded area after the red-filled spread, which suggests recessions generally came after yield curve flattened. However, not all the yield curve flatten would lead to a recession in US, such as the yield curve flatten in 1966-1967. The expected recession didn't show up until the spread became negative again in 3 years.
