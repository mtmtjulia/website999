Today is my graduation day! I haven't been on campus for almost 6 months due to the COVID-19, and I had to communicate with my mentor online. Also I finished my graduation thesis on how the timeliness and accuracy of the first pre-announcement published by listed companies affects the stock price crash risk during this period. 

I really enjoy my time studying here. This is the picture I took in front my favorite building on campus before I left.
