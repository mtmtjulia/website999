<p>Ultimate Frisbee combines all the best elements of American football, soccer, basketball, and everyone’s favorite beach sport: tossing a Frisbee disc. But a good game of Ultimate Frisbee is fast-paced, intense and strategic.</p>
<p>I started to play this sports when I was in high school, and it has been 7 years since then. I met some of my best friends through this process, and I will continue playing it as well. And it’s also easy for new learners and definitely worth trying.</p>
<p>I love Ultimate Frisbee!</p>
